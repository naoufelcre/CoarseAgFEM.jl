# Task: Refactor QuadMesh -> CoarseMeshBuilder + TransferOperator

## Test Case: Crescent Economy (crescent_economy.jl)
- Input: 1000x1000 Uniform Grid (Non-POT)
- Buffer Width: 4*h
- Max Coarsening Factor: 32

## Baseline (Old API)
- Total Coarse Cells: 57559
- Reduction: 94.24%

## Post-Refactor (New API: build_coarse_model)
- Total Coarse Cells: 57559 (MATCH)
- Reduction: 94.24%
- TransferOperator Mapping: 1,000,000 / 1,000,000 fine cells covered (100%).

## Conclusion
Refactoring successfully effectively sanitized the architecture (Transient Builder vs Permanent Model/Operator) without affecting numerical results.
